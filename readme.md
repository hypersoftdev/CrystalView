## Gradle Integration

### Step A: Add Maven Repository

In your project-level **build.gradle** or **settings.gradle** file, add the JitPack repository:
```
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```  

### Step B: Add Dependencies

In your app-level **build.gradle** file, add the library dependency. Use the latest version: 

Groovy Version
```
 implementation 'com.github.hypersoftdev:CrystalView:x.x.x'
```
Kts Version
```
 implementation("com.github.hypersoftdev:CrystalView:x.x.x")
```
